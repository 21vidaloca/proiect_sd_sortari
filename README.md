# Sorting Algorithms Benchmark
## Description
The project contains a number of well-known sorting algorithms that we are testing against some data sets. The data sets are various, we test the algorithms against random shuffles, ascending/descending order, and more.
## Using the application:
- First of all, execute the data set generator to generate your tests in the data folder: ```python3 sortgen.py```
- After that execute main: ```python3 main.py```
